            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is obſerveable that in all ages of the
<pb facs="tcp:1726:3"/>
world and throughout all countries in the world, that the helpe of grave and modeſt women (with us termed Midwives) hath ever been uſeful for releife &amp; ſuccour of all the daughters of Evah, whom God hath appointed to beare children into this world, which things ſo being, and women with all being Vniverſally as all men know (for the moſt part) unlearned, any further then to underſtand their owne native language, as a french wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to underſtand french, a dutch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dutch, or an engliſh woman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. And the buſineſſe whereunto God hath ordayned them of ſo great and dangerous conſequence as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the very lives of all ſuch as come into the world, and withall for preventing of great danger and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold hazards, both unto the mother
<pb facs="tcp:1726:3"/>
and unto the infant it being neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required that the parties imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereabout, ſhould underſtand the buſineſſe which they take in hand, which cannot be without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many particulars concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both the mother and the Infant, which they can never attaine unto, but either by the uſe of bookes pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by skilful Phyſitians &amp; Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, or by conference with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and skilfull (which can hardly, or not at all, in moſt places be had, or elſe by practicall &amp; long experience, which though it bee the ſureſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, yet is it the deareſt, and hath coſt the lives of many, both in this kinde and otherwiſe, before know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge could be therby obtained; theſe things ſo being, what reaſon hath any to ſeeke or debarre grave and modeſt
<pb facs="tcp:1726:4"/>
women, ſuch as God hath called to that function (or other grave and modeſt matrons; ſuch as though not ſo preciſely thereunto called, yet may bee aſsiſtant and helpefull unto the midwife in ſo great dangers, and whoſe paines &amp; labours alſo are of an abſolute neceſsity, in the mid-wives abſence) of the uſe of ſuch meanes as may inable them to the undertaking of matters ſo dangerous, and ſo full of perill, with much leſſe hazard to the patients, and paines and turmoylings to themſelves; for the unskilfulneſſe and want of knowledge in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife in matters both concerning the mother and the infant, doth queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe oftentimes indanger the lives, both of the one and the other, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure much unneceſſary trouble to themſelves, whenas, perhaps, had a
<pb facs="tcp:1726:4"/>
skilfull midwife the matter in hand, there would be neither perill to the one, nor paine to the other: but will ſome (nicely preciſe) perhaps ſay, <hi>It is unfit that ſuch matters as theſe ſhould bee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a vulgar tongue, for young heads to prie into.</hi> True, if by other meanes it might be effected: but the danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and manifold, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned for their ſex for the moſt part (further then their owne tongue) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all ages and in all places, (as I have ſaid) thereunto aſsigned; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it better that millions ſhould periſh for want of helpe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or that ſuch meanes which though lawfull in themſelves, yet may by ſome be abuſed, ſhould be had and uſed? doe we not ſee in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that thoſe things which otherwiſe were monſtrous, are yet by neceſsity
<pb facs="tcp:1726:5"/>
made tollerable? Or ſhall we becauſe ſome good things are by evill men and evill mindes abuſed, therefore deprive the good, of the uſe of good things? If ſuch ſlender reaſons as theſe might prevaile, then might there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a great number periſh, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſaw the light, who otherwiſe might live and increaſe the number of Gods church by their off-ſprings, and perhaps alſo a great deale more worke might be made for men-mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, then yet is, although there bee too too much already, and ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for private profit have too farre already incroached upon womens weakeneſſes and want of knowledge in theſe their peculiar buſineſſes. To conclude, I ſay onely this, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions herein are honeſt and iuſt, and my labours I bequeath to all grave,

modeſt and diſcreet women, as alſo to ſuch as by profeſsion, practiſe either Phyſicke or Chirurgery. And whoſe helpe upon occaſion of extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity may be uſefull and good, both for mother, child, and mid-wife.

For as they, every one of them from the ſeede of his kinde, caſt into the wombe of the earth, doe bud, or increaſe, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1726:10"/>
doe naturally grow to the perfect forme of his proper Nature: So man alſo, being a reaſonable creature, according to the quality of his body, doth naturally draw his originall &amp; beginning from the Sperme, and Seede of man, projected and caſt forth into the wombe of woman, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a field.

                  <note place="margin">From whence it hath its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</note>And it hath his beginning and breeding, from the reſidues and remnants, of all the meats belonging to the nouriſhment of man, after they be altered, and tranſmuted, even to the third Concoction: of the ſuperfluity of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted food, collected and gathered together, in his proper and due manner, it is evident that the ſame is ingendred, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the age and nature: For there is

So the blood exquiſitly wrought, and laboured, and, for the moſt part, converted into vitall ſpirit, is ſtreight-way conveyed by the Arterie, named <hi>Oborta,</hi> and branches thereof, to all the other members of the whole body. But <label type="milestone">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1726:11"/>
ſtrengthening life, which being the pureſt of all remained laſtly with the vitall ſpirit; that thing in like ſort being expelled, in ſweat thorow the pores, if any impure thing ſhall be remaining, or ingendred.</p>
               <p>But that the reaſon of this generation,<note place="margin">The like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſeeds in Plants.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning may be made more plaine, and evident unto us: we will declare by a briefe demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereunto added, that there is the ſame begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Plants, and herbes, and of other things, which fall under the ſame conſideration, that Plants and Herbs do. Therefore as in the ſeeds of every kinde, the graine it ſelfe caſt into the ground is the food, and, as it were, the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all the alteration following, whereby it budds &amp; ſprings, is augmented, and growes up into a Nature like unto it: ſo meat being taken, affordeth in mans body, the firſt, matter to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able concoction. And as there in Plants, we obſerve a moſt certaine ſeparation of the pure from the impure, and of the remnant from the ſuperfluous matter; ſo here we perceive a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeparation and ſequeſtration of that which is unprofitable from that which is profitable, by their certaine degrees. For, firſt the ſeed being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1726:12"/>
commited to the earth, by and by ſwelling with moiſture of the ſame, ſtrippeth it ſelfe from that little skin, in which it was incloſed, and ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upward, caſteth forth the ſame being empty, as a dry excrement, the graine in the meane time budding and ſprouting forth, that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> forward to the increaſe. Afterward the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and growing, ſtretching even to the fruit diſrobed and bereaved of the flower; the ſecond purging caſteth downe the flower ſprung up in the top of the bough, but preſerveth the hope of the fruit, being ſtripped of his flower, as that thing which remaineth pure and profitable, by the ſecond purging. Afterward, the fruit being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> growne to his juſt quantity, the third alteration caſteth downe the leaves, as the ſuperfluity of this degree, but ordaineth the fruit, being now ſo often cleanſed and purged, for the utility of the nauriſhm nt of men, maturity and ripeneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> granted unto it. But now either the ſeede breaketh the fruit, lying hid in it, or elſe it ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it out by putrefaction, and being caſt into the ground, it haſtenth againe into the property of its owne nature, not tending towards it ſelfe, which is remaing, but to the likeneſſe of his firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1726:12"/>
originall, from whence it had his beginning: that in the ſame it is altogether true.<note place="margin">Nature ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders things like unto it ſelfe.</note> That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ingender things like unto it ſelfe: For every thing doth naturally covet, and deſire the forme and likeneſſe of that, from whence it is bred: whereby thou canſt not ſee apples, to grow from a peare, nor peares from an apple, unleſſe it be otherwiſe procured by the meanes of grafting, and planting. Wherefore the ſame thing remaineth, to be acknowledged in the Generation of man and woman, which is to be confeſſed in the growing of Plants and Herbes, that becauſe wee ſee bodies well diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by members, to be ingendred of ſeede, wee may alſo beleeve that the ſame ſeed doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the diſtinct,<note place="margin">Whether the ingendring-ſeed be from the braine.</note> and ſeverall parts of the body; wherefore let them looke what and how well they ſpeake which doe affirme, the ſeed of Generation to be ingendred of the braine onely, when as it is not ſo agreeable to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the concoctions,<note place="margin">A good part of the ſeed deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the braine; but the greateſt part is from the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts of the whole body.</note> nor to the conſtitution of the bodies. Truely, it is certaine that ſome, neither alſo a ſmall part, is derived from the braine, but the chiefeſt part is collected and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together from the chiefeſt parts of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1726:13"/>
whole body. For if wee ſay, that this ſhould be ingendred of one, or two parts onely: every man ſhall perceive that this conſequence would follow by an infallible reaſon,<note place="margin">What the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would be, if the ſeede ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of one or two parts alone.</note> to wit, that thoſe ſame parts only, ſhould be ingendred againe. Therefore wee ſay rightly, that beſides that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which it draweth from the braine, it is ingendred from the whole body, and the moſt eſpeciall parts of the ſame, the effect it ſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the cauſe, moſt eſpecially when wee ſee diſtinct members, and perfectly finiſhed, according to the due forme of the body, in things procreated and brought forth. We have on our ſide,<note place="margin">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1726:13"/>
conſtantly believe, to have paſſed into them, by the corruption of the ſeed.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is naturall.</note>The firſt faculty and vertue is naturall, being the mover and foundation of the other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, common both to living Creatures, and to Plants. This, by and by, from the time of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, doth worke, even untill the perfection of that which is ingendred, namely, by aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and nouriſhing. And it hath his place and ſeat in the Liver, and from thence is diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſent abroad by veines into the whole body: But the operation of it at firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is found to be three-fold. Thy altering,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1726:17"/>
or changing faculty (the which ſome doe call the immutative faculty) which firſt generally immuteth, and altereth the ſubſtance of the Seede, and alſo converteth and digeſteth it,<note place="margin">1. The altering or changing faculty.</note> from that which it was before, into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſeverall parts, that every one of them may be diſtinctly compoſed and made: and particularly inclining againe into that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by thoſe mixed qualities, and elementary faculties, by heat and moiſture effecteth and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſofter ſubſtance, ſuch as fleſh is in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, but in Plants, or Herbes, the flowers and the pith: by heate and drineſſe it frameth the heart is living Creatures; in Plants, or Herbes, is maketh the roots: by cold and moiſture, in living Creatures, it maketh and workes the haires; in Plants, or Herbs, the leaves: alſo by cold and drineſſe, in living Creatures, it worketh and maketh ſinewes and bones; and in Plants, or Herbs, the rinds, barkes, and wood. Afterward, the forming or faſhioning faculty,<note place="margin">2. The forming or faſhioning faculty.</note> or vertue (which others call the Informative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty) is that which formeth and faſhioneth the matter which is changed, to the ſimilitude and likeneſſe of that from whence it drew his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1726:18"/>
and beginning, the parts like unto their firſt originall, being ſeverally diſpoſed and ordered. By this vertue and faculty, the parts, which ought and ſhould be hollow, as the guts, veines, arteries, and ſuch like, are made hollow, and thoſe parts which ought to be maſſie and ſolid, are in like manner formed ſo. And in few words, it formeth all things, yea, the ſmalleſt of them particularly, and perfecteth the ſuperfice, or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt face of every little particle, or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive portion, ſo that nothing remaineth idle, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The helping, or minſtring faculties.</note>But to theſe principall faculties, belonging to naturall force, in perfecting the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, other helping, or rather miniſtring, faculties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are added beſide.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1726:18"/>
wombe, from the time that the ſeede is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that it may ſuffice for the compoſing and ordaining of ſo many,<note place="margin">To the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty, foure other aiding and helping facul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties.</note> and ſo great parts of the living Creature. And to this laſt faculty and vertue, foure other aiding and helping faculties, are ſaid to approach. The attractive, which ſome call the appetitive faculty, which attracteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> convenient nutriment and food to the ſeverall parts, by his force, as with an inſtrument; as for the nouriſhment of fleſh, it attracteth the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of blood, and for the aliment and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the braine, the ſubſtance of Phlegme, and ſo likewiſe in the other parts, working by his hot and dry faculty. The concocting or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vertue, working by a hot and dry faculty and power, changeth and tranſmuteth the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the nutriment, and reduceth the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments of a diverſe nature, as it were, into one maſſe or lumpe. The reteining or retentive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> faculty, which reteineth and helpeth the pure nutriment (whereby that being digeſted is aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated, made like, and is united to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members) uſing the helpe of coldneſſe and drineſſe. The expelling or expulſive facultie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which by the helpe of moiſture and coldneſſe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1726:19"/>
doth neceſſarily expell and void ſuperfluous things, neither agreeable or convenient to the quantity, nor quality of the parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by no meanes to be aſſimilated and united to the parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond principall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is named Vital.</note>The ſecond faculty and vertue which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth principally in humane ſeed, is called Vitall, and poſſeſſeth his ſeat and manſion in the heart. And that quickneth and giveth life to the heart, from whom the vitall Spirit by the Arteries annexed to it, doth proceed to the members, to be quickned and revived by the diſpoſition of a naturall faculty and vertue, by dilating and contracting the Heart and Arteries. By dilating and enlarging, I ſay, becauſe the moving force and power which remaineth in the heart, doth dilate and ſpread abroad the motion of the heart it ſelfe, from the middle and Center of it, into all the extreme and outward parts. But by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting and knitting together, becauſe the ſame force and faculty collecteth and contracteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the motion of the heart from the extreme and outward parts, to the middle and Center of it.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is named Animal, and is three-fold.</note>The third faculty is Animal, which, as the Queene, doth poſſeſſe the higheſt place, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a ſeat in the braine. And the ſame is certainly found to be three-fold: For, the firſt vertue of the ſame,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1726:20"/>
to the Senate and Councel-chamber of Reaſon, there, as it were, to be examined by judgement and determined: and whatſoever is here collected, and approved by judgement, that it ſendeth and committeth to Memory, to be reſerved (as it were, in a treaſury or ſtore-houſe) and to be directed, concerning his acts and effects.<note place="margin">2. The Senſitive faculty.</note> The ſecond vertue is the Senſitive faculty, the which although we know, that it is variable and diverſe, in reſpect of the ſenſes, yet we may underſtand, that it is cauſed and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this manner. The Animal ſpirit (whoſe place of late we ſaid to be in the braine) procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the interiour and inward little caves and ventricles of the braine,<note place="margin">The Animal Spirit doth forme and frame the ſenſes.</note> by the mediation and aſſiſtance of certaine ſubtile and ſlender ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, doth forme and frame the Senſes, and by his vertue through the miniſtry and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſinewes, directeth and tranſpoſeth ſight to the eyes, ſmelling to the noſtrills, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the eares, and taſting to the palate of the mouth, which ſenſes wee ſee onely to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and nominated of the ſenſes of the head. The third is the Moving vertue,<note place="margin">3. The Moving faculty.</note> ingendred and bred in the braine; to whom it is ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1726:21"/>
to move and give motion: For as the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirit diſpoſeth and directeth the orders and properties of the ſenſes,<note place="margin">The Animal ſpirit directs the motions.</note> as is before declared, ſo by the benefit of the ſame facultie, the motions alſo are directed, by which the vertues and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Spirit are dilated, opened, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and are likewiſe conveyed and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to the other members.</p>
               <p>But for the perfection, and complement of all theſe vertues and faculties, Spirit is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required,<note place="margin">Spirit neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the former facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> by whoſe benefit and continuall motion, as well the ſenſes, as the faculties, are inſtigated and provoked to performe and finiſh their faculties and actions. And they ſay, that the Spirit is a certaine airy ſubſtance, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exciteth and ſtirreth up the powers and faculties of the body, to fulfill and accompliſh their actions.

But
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1726:21"/>
firſt this is directed and conduced to the Liver in this manner: Heate remaining in the blood,<note place="margin">How naturall ſpirit is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> there is cauſed a certaine boyling in the Liver, from whence a certaine fume or vapour iſſueth and proceedeth forth, which eft-ſoones being purified, by the veines of the Liver is changed and tranſmuted into a certaine airie ſubſtance, and is called Naturall Spirit, which purifieth and clarifieth the blood, and afterward is ſent and diſtributed to the particular and ſeverall members.</p>
               <p>Afterward the ſame Spirit is transferred and carried from the Liver by certaine veines to the Heart,<note place="margin">How vitall ſpirit is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> where by the motion of the parts of the Heart, and a mutuall coagitation, it is made more pure, and is converted into a more ſubtile and finer Nature, and beginneth to be Vitall and truely Spirit: becauſe is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth and ſpreadeth it ſelfe from the Heart by Arteries, to the members of the whole body, and doth augment and further the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Naturall Spirit.</p>
               <p>And againe,<note place="margin">How Animal ſpirit is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> the ſame Spirit mounting and penetrating upward, from the Heart through Arteries, to the little caves and ventricles of

the braine, is there more exactly laboured and refined, and is tranſmuted and altered into the eſſence and ſubſtance of the Animal Spirit,<note place="margin">Animal Spirit moſt pure.</note> which is moſt pure of all, from whence ſtreight-way it is ſent and conducted againe by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and inſtruments of the ſenſes, to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſtrengthen thoſe ſenſes in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

               <p>But we muſt not beleeve that this Spirit is the immortall ſoule infuſed into man of God,<note place="margin">Whether the Spirit be the Soule.</note> but it is onely the inſtrument, and, as it were, the Charriot of the ſame.<note place="margin">The Spirit but the inſtrument or Charriot of the Soule.</note> For by the meanes alone of this Spirit, the ſoule is conjoyned and united to the body: neither yet alſo is there any perfect exerciſe of the ſoule, without the miniſtry and ſervice of this ſpirit, which thing might eaſily be proved, but that already, this diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the faculties and Spirit, hath beene overlong.</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1726:46"/>Take Saxifrage, Camomile, Salt, Dill, of each a handfull: Alſo they may uſe this Electuary, in the morning, and when they goe to bed. Take Electuarium laetificans mixed and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Been, white &amp; red, beaten to powder. But eſpecially this thing (which is knowne by much experience) ſhall greatly profit.</p>
               <p>Take the little skinnes extracted and drawne out of ſtomackes of Hens, and let them take them beaten to fine powder for a few daies in the morning faſting with Wine, the waight of a French-crowne. And theſe, truely, are generall precepts, fit and convenient for many accidents and changes, that it may be certainly evident and apparent to every one, how they ought to carry and demeane themſelves from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception even untill the time of the birth, the knowledge of the which is not ſo profitable, as the uſe is neceſſary.</p>

we muſt uſe the Precepts delivered and ſet downe in this Chapter. Before all things, let the Midwife be ſo skilfull of the matter, that ſo much as lieth in her power, ſhe may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and readily decline and avoyd all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hindrances of the birth.<note place="margin">If the birth be hindred by the drineſſe or ſtraitneſſe of the necke of the Matrix, what to doe.</note> But if it ſhall happen that the birth is hindred by ſiceity, drineſſe, or ſtraitneſſe of the necke or privie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Matrix, a little quantity of ſneeſing-powder and Pepper is to be blowne into the noſtrills of the labourig-woman with a quill; alſo her mouth is to be kept cloſe, and her breath to be kept in, and ſternutation or ſneefing is to be provoked, whereby the breath being driven downward, may thruſt and depreſſe the Infant to the nether moſt parts.

Our medicine, which we moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially uſe, the birth being hindred, and paines of travelling failing and ſlaking, is this: Take of the Trochiskes of Myrrh one ounce, Saffron ten graines, Cinamome one ſcruple, mingle them with two ounces of the water of Mugwoort or Peniroyall, and make one draught of it.</p>
               <p>Let the labouring-woman take this draught warme, which being taken,<note place="margin">A Potion.</note> let her returne to bed againe about the ſpace of an houre, untill feeling the force of this Potion her pangs and paines ſtirred up againe, ſhee riſing up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her labour and travell.

               <p>FOraſmuch as the parts of the Matrix are two, of which both do conſiſt of ſinewes, wrinckled fleſh, and groſſe thickneſſe (as wee have mentioned in the third Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) we muſt know, that the inward part of it (whoſe port or entrance, is almoſt unſenſible and moſt ſtreight, neither is opened at any time, but in the act of Generation, iſſuing of the Termes, and in the birth) is able to abide and admit ſo great a dilatation and enlargement, that it ſufficeth to afford free paſſage to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1726:60"/>
to come forth out of the wombe, if the birth ſhall be naturall, without any detriment or hurt to the child or mother. But when the Infant of himſelfe can neither finde nor open this way (as at other times by Nature hee is wont) becauſe of the reſtriction and ſtraitneſſe of the privie-paſſage, and becauſe the vaults and caves of the ſame are ſtopped: then let the Midwife convey her fingers in, her hands being annointed, and let her dilate, amplifie, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large that ſtrictneſſe and narrowneſſe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently as ſhe can, in bredth only, but not in length at all, leſt the ligaments and holders of the Matrix be broken,<note place="margin">The precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or falling downe of the Matrix.</note> and the precipitation and ſudden falling downe of the Matrix doe follow, being a diſeaſe uncurable, I ſay, the perverting and diſordering of the ſame, with the proceſſe and comming forth of the necke of the Matrix. Therefore let the Midwife in dilating and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inward part, move it forward, that the head of the Infant which is neereſt, may put it ſelfe forth from thence, and may proceed and come forth into the utter part, to wit, the necke of the Matrix. For the dilatation and opening of the inward part, now ſpoken of, can neither
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1726:61"/>
hurt or indammage the mother nor the babe, becauſe Nature her ſelfe, doth in an eaſie birth amplifie and extend the ſame, and alſo after the birth ſhut and cloſe the ſame together againe. But if the child cannot proceed forth for the ſtraightneſſe and narrowneſſe of the other part, that is to ſay, of the necke, but ſticke there with his head, the other part of his body remaining as yet in the inward receptacle, or ſeede-plot (which thing ſeldome hapneth, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth rightly) then wee muſt know, that the port-paſſage, or outward gate, that is to ſay, the ſecrets may be more extended, dilated &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and that they may better endure all the difficulties of the birth, than the inward recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle or vault, and therefore let the midwife al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo amplifie &amp; open that gate or entrance againe according to the quality of the matter, that the whole Infant may come forth to the birth.</p>
               <p>And if theſe aforeſaid things ſhall afford no ſuccour, ſo that the Infant remaineth as yet fixed and unmovable, and all the paines and pangs of the birth ſhall ceaſe, then the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-woman ſhall be brought to her bed againe and be holpen with theſe medicines following,

which are ſuch,<note place="margin">Medicines able to expell dead children, the Secundines, abortives, the falſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Molae.</note> that they are able to expell and drive forth both dead children, the Secundines retained behind, and alſo abortives, and the falſe conceptions, named <hi>Molae.</hi> Firſt of all, as ſoone as ſhe ſhall be brought to her bed, let her take this potion warme, and that being taken, let her abſtaine from all other meat, and let her reſt quietly the ſpace of one or two houres, untill ſhe thoroughly feele the force and efficacy of it.

It will profit much to make fumes and vapours with them.</p>
               <p>But if ſhe finde no helpe by them, ſhe may uſe this Emplaiſter laid upon her belly.<note place="margin">An Emplaiſter</note> Take Galbanum one ounce and a halfe, Colocyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this without the ſeeds two drams, the juyces of Rue, Mugwoort, new waxe ſo much as fufficeth; make a Plaiſter of them.

               <p>But after all theſe things being uſed,<note place="margin">When &amp; how we muſt uſe Inſtruments.</note> but eſpecially, if the Midwife ſhall not be able to make way and paſſage for the Infant, the parts of the Matrix being enlarged and amplified as they ſhould, Inſtruments wholly fit and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for thoſe uſes ſhall be uſed.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1726:63"/>
But if another way ſhall pleaſe, and ſeeme more commodious to the Midwife, let her bring the woman to her bed, in which let her lie, her head declining and bending backeward a little, but her buttockes lifted ſomewhat higher than all the reſt, and her legges drawne unto her ſo much as may be. Then with either of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which ſhall pleaſe beſt, being annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let the Midwife begin to worke, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed forward.

And the bathe ſhall be prepared in this manner. Take of Mariſh Mallowes with the roots ſixe handfuls, of other Mallowes, Branca Vrſina, or beares foot (or if it bee not to bee had) Violet leaves,

               <p>Thoſe things being beaten to powder, which are to be powdred, let them be put in a bag, and let them boyle in the water, in which the ſicke woman ſhall ſit.

               <p>In the yeare 1552 in England not far from Oxford a certaine deformed birth was borne; with two heads, foure armes, with ſo many hands, with one belly having the ſecret parts of a woman, and one fundament. On the one ſide, there were two feete over-thwart: on the other, one onely ſtretched out right of forme of two feet, having tenne toes. One of them lived fifteene daies, and the other lived one day more. They wept ſeldome in this time. One of

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Of the cauſes and ſignes of aborcement, or untimely births, and alſo of all manner of cure of ſuch as ſuffer abortion.</head>
               <p>WE muſt underſtand,<note place="margin">The cauſes of aborcement are two-fold.</note> that it happeneth from inward and outward cauſes, that women ſuffer aborcement, that is to ſay, bring forth an immature Feature, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fruit. The inward cauſes,<note place="margin">Inward cauſes.</note> are conſidered from the Feature it ſelfe, or from the Matrix; If it happen by the Feature, it is cauſed, for that the Cotilidons are over-weake (which are veines
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1726:94"/>
by which the conception is tied and faſtned in the Matrix) by whoſe feebleneſſe and weakneſſe the mouthes, or ſpecks of the veines in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, named in Latine <hi>Acetabula,</hi> are cauſed to be quickly diſſolved and broken, and aborcement doth follow. Againe, if the coats, or caules alſo, wherein the childe is wrapped and infolded in the womb, be looſed, diſſolved and broken through debility and weakneſſe, and the retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and incloſed humours doe iſſue forth, by which fluxe, the Matrix is made ſlippery and feebliſh, and the Feature deſtitute of moiſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, doe periſh and be deſtroyed: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo likewiſe, if venomous humours flow and iſſue forth, and ſtirre and pricke forward the expulſive faculty of the Matrix. It chanceth alſo ſometime, that abortion is cauſed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Matrix, by an inward cauſe; that happeneth when the woman is weake, and waxing feeble and faint, doth ſubſtract and withdraw nouriſhment from the Feature, that it hath no augmentation, nor ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ingender and procreate the members. Further, in reſpect of the Matrix, the wide and ample largeneſſe of the mouth of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1726:94"/>
and the immoderate humidity and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſame, the evill diſpoſition and diſtemperature of the qualities, alſo ventoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or vapours incloſed within the Matrix, and the ulcers and Apoſtumations of the ſame doe miniſter and afford a cauſe and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of aborcement: And alſo other maladies and infirmities, as an immoderat flux of blood, an unkinde looſeneſſe of the belly, the diſeaſe Tenaſmus (which is a deſire to goe to ſtoole when nothing can be voided) the cough,<note place="margin">Tenaſmus.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſneeſing, and what things ſoever do ſhake the body over-much: yea, likewiſe every ſharp ſickneſſe, which doth ſo moleſt the body of the woman, that it diſperſeth the nutriments of the Feature.<note place="margin">Outward cauſes.</note> Beſides the externall or outward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which chance outwardly, and haſten and procure aborcement, are alſo many: ſuch as are, falls, running, leaping or dauncing, riding, immoderate exerciſe and blowes. Alſo inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and intemperate application and uſe of things, which are without the body, as of the aire too hot, or too cold. For great coldneſſe doth deſtroy the Feature; but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much heate intercepteth and keepeth away
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1726:95"/>
the aire from the Infant, and ſtifleth and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth him in the wombe. Hot bathes alſo effect the ſame thing, if women doe uſe them the firſt three moneths after conception: Alſo noyſome ſtinckes and ſavours doe provoke and procure abortion, as of Lamps or Candles newly put out, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth. Likewiſe an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate uſing of unkinde meate and drinke; as by the greedy deſire of an unnaturall appetite, to eate immoderate ſtore of Salt, to eate coales dirt, or ſuch things, by which naughty and corrupt humours, or hurtfull drineſſe is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and procured. Alſo great hunger doth hurt the Feature very much; and over-much reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſurfeting, the waies and paſſages of nouriſhment being ſoone ſtopped, doth ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and choke him. Further, immoderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, intemperate labours, immoderate ſleep; alſo unſeaſonable and over-much watching, or continuall ſluggiſhneſſe and ſlothfulneſſe, doe harme and endamage the Feature. Likewiſe other accidents and chances, ſuch as are, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fury, great danger, exceeding great feare, over-much ſorrow, ſudden joy, dull appetite, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of things not to be gotten, immoderate

Further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if the ſhivering Agues, coldneſſe, and paines of the head with a miſtineſſe and dimneſſe of the eyes ſhall ſuddenly ceaze upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conceived with childe. All which things

                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1726:102"/>Some women beare about them a claw taken from the foot of a Beare.

For they ſay they have ſuch great efficacy to hinder the birth, that the woman cannot be delivered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they bee removed. Wherefore they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh that they muſt bee alwaies removed and taken away in time. Alſo the ſtone named <hi>Lapis Aetiles</hi> (which ſome ſay is found in an Eagles neſt) is proved againſt Aborcements and over haſtie birthes, which in like manner is reported to further and promote a lingring and over-flow birth.</p>

               <p>ALthough it be a hard thing to know the true conception of women, yet we may give a coniecture by many ſignes, and attaine unto it by ſome arguments confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ratified by experience. It is credited for certaine ſigne of conception, if the woman, the tenth day or ſome day ſooner, after ſhee had company carnally with man, ſhall perceive the Termes to bee white or red by reaſon of humours, alſo the ſtopping and retention of the Termes is accompted for a ſigne, yet it deceiveth, becauſe it happeneth alſo often times without conception. Therefore this being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, wee will proſecute other notes and ſignes taken from the body of the woman her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concerning true conception, every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and part examined, and firſt the beginning ſhall proceed from the head.</p>
               <p>The paines of the head, ſwimming of the brain,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1726:104"/>
and dymneſſe of the eyes, if they concurre and chance together, doe ſignifie conception.</p>
               <p>The apples of the eyes are leſſened.</p>
               <p>The eyes ſwell and are changed into a ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colour.</p>
               <p>The little veines doe waxe red, and begin to ſwell with bloud.</p>
               <p>The eyes ſinke downe into the head.</p>
               <p>The eye-lids become feeble.</p>
               <p>Divers colours are ſeene in the eyes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a looking-glaſſe.</p>

               <p>The little veines placed betwixt the noſe and eyes, are ſwolne with bloud, and are ſeene more clearely and plainely than they were wont.</p>
               <p>The veine under the tongue waxeth gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
               <p>The necke is hot, the backe-bone cold.</p>

               <p>The veines ſituated in the breaſt, at firſt wax blacke, afterward begin to be yellow, or to be of a blewiſh-colour.</p>
               <p>The dugs begin to ſwell and wax hard with paines.</p>

               <p>The Matrix is reſtreyned and cloſed.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this thing is procured by other cauſes alſo, it may bee obſerved and noted by an infallible and certaine difference, when it foreſheweth conception.

               <p>The ſecret parts of the woman are wrinkled even unto the ſeaventh moneth. The wombe waxeth round, and ſwelleth. About the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Conception, paines of the belly and backe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1726:106"/>
ſo alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> admoniſheth us, ſaying; When the Termes are retained and ſtayed; and neither Fevers, nor fit of Agues doe follow, and alſo an abhorring and refuſall of meat happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the woman; we muſt underſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that the woman is conceived with childe.</p>

               <p>The Pulſe at firſt beateth ſwiftly, by and by ſlowly.</p>
               <p>The excrements of the belly are voided more hardly and painfully, becauſe the guts are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and thruſt together.</p>
               <p>The urine or water, is white, a little cloud flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſwimming aloft, and many motes are ſeene in it, as in the beames of the Sun: but firſt of all, in the firſt moneth, when many ſuch like things do ſinck down to the bottome, they are drawn out in length like unto wooll, the Vrinall being moved in which they are in.</p>
               <p>In the later moneths the urine is red or yellow, but at length it becommeth blacke, a little red cloud ſwimming above.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1726:107"/>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth us to make triall of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception with water mingled with Hony, that if the women having taken this, lying downe in her bed ſhall feele gripings or wringings of the belly, then it is a ſigne ſhe hath conceived, if ſhe doe not, ſhe hath not yet conceived with child.</p>
               <p>Whereas ſome would have this experiment to be practiſed by a ſuffumigation received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, that maketh little or nothing to the matter. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth, that ſo the ſignes and tokens of barrenneſſe and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are to be obſerved, and not of conception; but they which attribute to fumes made under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neath any thing for the ſearching out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, do ſay, that the fume made of the thing put underneath muſt be reſtrained &amp; kept that it aſcend not up to the noſtrills, they would have ſuch conjecture to be taken of Garlicke put underneath, and Ariſtolochia uſed with it. But by what probable reaſon, they themſelves know beſt.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be a more certaine experiment, to ſtop cloſe the Vrine of the woman put into a glaſſe for three daies, which time being ended, let it be ſtrained thorow a cleane fine linnen-cloth, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1726:107"/>
if ſhe have conceived, there will appeare little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, like unto Lice, if they be red, they ſay, they do portend and ſignifie a man childe, if they be white, they ſay a maiden-childe is conceived.</p>
               <p>And ſome doe affirme this thing for a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: If a ſmooth and bright needle be put into the Vrine of a woman, in a brazen Baſon, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cloſe a night, on the morrow, if the woman have conceved, that needle will be ſpeckled with red ſpots, if ſhe have not, it will be blacke and ruſty.</p>
               <p>If a woman take the juyce of Carduus, and ſhall caſt it up againe being taken, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a certain, ſigne of conception. And ſo much concerning confuſed ſignes of conceptions (that is to ſay, ſuch as concerne Male and Female both alike.)</p>
               <p>But whether a man-child or woman-child be conceived, it is delivered and ſet downe to be marked &amp; obſerved by theſe ſignes following.</p>
               <p>If it be a man-child,<note place="margin">The ſignes of a man-childe.</note> the right-eye is moved more often, and is better affected with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall colour than the left.</p>
               <p>The right breſt is more plump and harder
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1726:108"/>
than the left, the colour of the nipples is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſooner.</p>
               <p>Milk breedeth ſooner, and if it be drawne out and oppoſed, and ſet againſt the beames of the Sun in a glaſſe, it cleaveth together into a little cleare lump, not unlike unto a cleare Pearle.</p>
               <p>If the milke of the woman conceived with child be ſprinkled into her urine, it ſinketh by and by to the bottome, if Salt be put to it, it doth not melt.</p>
               <p>The lid of the right eye is redder, and all the colour of the face is better than it was wont, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> telleth us. Leſſe heavineſſe is felt.</p>
               <p>The firſt moving, for the moſt part the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day, is felt more quicker in the right ſide. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> inſtructing concerning the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of children in the womb, doth advertiſe us that male-children lie on the right ſide, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-children on the left; becauſe men-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have need of more heat, which they attract and draw unto them from the Liver, ſcituated and ſeated in the ſame ſide.</p>
               <p>If the Flowers iſſue forth the fortieth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conception</p>
               <p>The belly is more ſharpe about the Navell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1726:108"/>The woman when ſhe goeth a journy, putteth forth her right foot firſt, and in riſing up from her ſeat, ſhe doth ſooner ſtay her ſelf, and lift her ſelf up upon her right hand, than upon her left.</p>
               <p>The pulſe is more ſwift in the right hand, than in the left.</p>
               <p>But if they ſhall conceive maiden-children,<note place="margin">The ſignes of the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den child.</note> all things happen otherwiſe, and theſe ſignes, for the moſt part, are obſerved.</p>
               <p>The firſt moving, for the moſt part, is made the nintieth day after conception.</p>
               <p>The moving is made on the left ſide.</p>
               <p>Women-children are carried in the wombe with great paines.</p>
               <p>The legs doe ſwell, and alſo the privie parts.</p>
               <p>The colour is more pale.</p>
               <p>The appetite is more vehement.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, a loathing and abhorring of meat more ſoone and ſpeedy.</p>
               <p>The Termes doe iſſue forth about the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day after conception.</p>
               <p>If the powder of Ariſtolochia be tempered with Hony, and the loynes and the ſecrets be annointed with it, it is thought to be an eaſie thing to diſcerne the ſex: that if the ſpittle of the child-bearing-woman ſhall be ſweete, ſhee
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1726:109"/>
beareth a man childe, if it ſhall be bitter, ſhee beareth a woman-childe.</p>
               <p>The age alſo of women availeth not a little. For women which are young, doe ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive boyes, but ſuch as are ſomewhat aged, doe ſooner conceive girles, by reaſon of the defect of heat in the Matrix cauſed by old age.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe maiden-children are ingendred by parents moiſt and cold by nature, of ſeed more moiſt, cold, and liquid than ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>And it may alſo be obſerved by certaine ſignes, whether the child be in good ſtate in the wombe or no. If the Babe be well, the Paps, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teſtifieth, are hard. If it be not in health, watriſh milke doth flow forth from the dugs voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Againe, if their Termes doe iſſue forth often-times which are conceived with child, as <hi>Pliny</hi> averreth, they ſignifie that the childe is not in health and lively, but weake and feeble.</p>
               <p>Further, fat women commonly doe beare feeble children.</p>
               <p>If the Hydropſie ſuddenly invade and take a woman with childe, and her noſtrills, eares, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1726:109"/>
lips begin to be red, they portend and ſhew that the fruit in the wombe is dead.</p>
               <p>If a woman beare Twins, of which one is a man-child, the maiden-childe is in great danger, becauſe they are nouriſhed and proſper in the wombe with a diverſe kind of nouriſhment, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth. There is leſſe danger if they be maiden-children: For under <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, a certaine woman brought forth three maiden-children at one birth, all which came unto a perfect age.</p>
               <p>If a woman conceive before, or about the purging of her Flowers, infected and venomous humours will be mixed to the ſeed, of which, it is found moſt commonly, that Lepers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred (otherwiſe the learned doe declare, that conception is not cauſed, but the Termes beginning or ceaſing to flow.)</p>
               <p>If a woman conceive once,<note place="margin">A ſuperfaetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or after-conception.</note> and a little time after conceive againe, the laſt ſeede will hardly live in the wombe. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> declareth, that a woman brought forth two men-children at one birth alive, and that the fifth moneth after ſhe brought forth another, but dead before in the wombe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:1726:110"/>If the Infant doe proceed out of the wombe after the ninth moneth, for the moſt part hee is weake and feeble.</p>
               <p>If a young maiden conceive before her firſt Flowers, ſhe ingendreth an excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature.</p>
               <p>All theſe things being declared, this alſo is to be underſtood, which Midwives are wont to obſerve concerning the iſſue to come, I meane, whether the woman ſhall bring forth more children: For how many knots they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be in the Navell of the childe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne, ſo many men-children ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be ingendred, as they ſay.

               <p>NO man doubteth, but that the deceits and ſleights of the Divell are infinit: amongſt which hee hath that, whereby (as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture teſtifieth) he is able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe into an Angell of Light, and to take unto himſelfe the ſhapes of men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to reſemble them, the Righteous God permitting and ſuffering him; the which thing to be ſo, variable experience of things doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. Wherefore it ſhall not be needfull to call that into queſtion.</p>
               <p>But whether he may have carnall company with men and women, but eſpecially, whether hee can cauſe women to be conceived with childe, needeth no queſtion. No man doth deny, but that he may have carnall copulation with them, having taken the ſhape of man or woman: For, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifieth the ſame thing, ſaying, There is a conſtant report, taken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1726:111"/>
from the teſtimony of them, to whom theſe things hapened, that there be certaine Spirits, Divells and ſavage people, which ſometimes have allured women, and have had their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them; but the ſame thing is not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the ancient, but among us alſo is found to be ſo by many examples.</p>
               <p>In a few yeeres paſt, a certaine Harlot, having her body laſciviouſly abuſed of the Divell, in the night, comming in the ſhape of a man, did ſtreight way fall into a moſt great ſickneſſe, ſo that her wombe and privity were quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with a conſumption or rotting <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena,</hi> ſo that when no medicine could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the helliſh fury of the diſeaſe, her intralls alſo and parts about her ſecret members did fall out of her body. There was alſo a certaine Butchers ſervant, which making a journy, and thinking of Lechery, had a Divell to meete him in the beautifull ſhape of a woman, with whom hee lay, not knowing hee had any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a Divell; but by and by, his privie members being inflam'd with a fiery heat, were exulcerated with a ſpeedy putrefaction and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And indeed, God, who is alwaies juſt and

righteous, is wont to permit theſe things by his juſt Iudgement, for the puniſhment of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, and admonition of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſsianus</hi> doth deny this act, ſaying, that it is an impoſſible thing, that a Spirituall creature ſhould have carnall copulation with men and women, neither that this thing ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: becauſe, if the act goe before, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary likewiſe that ſometime alſo the effect ſhould follow, that is, that ſomething ſhould be ingendred, which thing as yet may not be evident by any experience. Againe, if this act were poſſible to divells and ſpirits, he ſaith, they would rather be mutually turned toward themſelves, than to be commixed with men or women. Therefore concerning the truth of the matter, theſe things are to be accounted for the exceeding ſubtilty and deceit of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and wicked perſwaſion of men, ſo farre forth that we doe not beleeve, that either the divells can cauſe women to be with childe, nor on the other ſide, that divells aſſuming and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto them the forme and ſhape of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be conceived with childe by men. For that never any man was borne without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1726:112"/>
humane ſeede (Ieſus Chriſt our onely Lord and Saviour, the onely eternall Sonne of the onely God excepted, conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) wee affirme as a moſt true thing. Wherefore concerning that which is rehearſed of one <hi>Merlin,</hi> we entertaine no otherwiſe than a Fable and a Tale agreeing with his name in the Germane tongue. Hee, which ſhall deſire to know the Hiſtory of him, ſhall finde it at large in the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Booke of <hi>Vincentius,</hi> named <hi>Hiſtoriale Speculum,</hi> the thirtieth Chapter. Truly by the law of Nature, it is certaine, that like things are ingendered of their like, therefore a man could not be borne of the Divell, neither have wee knowne at any time, that the moſt righteous and omnipotent God hath permitted ſo much unto ſpirits and divels, or granted them ſo large a licence, as that they ſhould be able to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and procreate children by men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and as it were, to ordaine and conſtitute their divelliſh iſſue &amp; damnable brood in man created after the ſimilitude of God. But if a Sorcereſſe and Witch was his mother, ſhee was not aſhamed to gratifie the Divell, to blab
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1726:112"/>
abroad ſo great and monſtrous a lie to pervert the mindes of many with this falſe opinion. She might have her body abuſed by the Divel, but ſhee could not conceive a man by him. If hee had not abuſed her body laſciviouſly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he was able to cauſe her wombe to ſwell by his divelliſh and deſpightfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, that ſhe might thinke her ſelfe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with childe by him. Alſo ſo long time being ended, as women are wont to beare a child in the wombe, he is able to ſtirre up grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous paines and pangs in the wombe, and alſo craftily to put a child underneath her, brought from another place: alſo ſtreight way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and repreſſe thoſe tumours and ſwellings ſtirred and raiſed up by ſome Windy vapours. For ſuch a like thing is manifeſt in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our times: For at <hi>Conſtantia</hi> (a Citty in Germany) a certaine beautifull maid-ſervant of a certaine Citizens, named <hi>Magdalen,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred of the Divell, after ſhe being caſt into priſon had utterly renounced him by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (moved by the counſell of devout Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Word of God, by Divines reaſons) from that time ſhe felt ſo great torments in her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1726:113"/>
wombe, that ſhe did thinke almoſt that every houre ſhe ſhould be delivered of a childe. But the helpe of Midwives being often imployed, ſhe voided iron nailes, pieces of wood, broken glaſſes, haires, towe, ſtones, bones, iron, and innumerable ſuch like things through the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, all which things verily the wicked Spirit had ſubtilly and maliciouſly conveyed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and brought in. The ſame <hi>Vincentius</hi> citeth ſome other Hiſtories ſerving to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and queſtion, in the twenty ſixt and twenty ſeventh Chapter of his Booke, named <hi>Naturale Speculum.</hi> Namely, that a certaine young-man caught a woman by the haire of the head ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing her ſelfe in the Sea, about the evening, whom he tooke to wife, after he had brought her home to his houſe, and begot a ſonne by her. But ſhe not ſpeaking a word at all hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that her husband compelled her to ſpeake, moved by inſtigation of others, which ſaid ſhe was a ſpirit, making a ſhew as if hee would murther the child begotten of her, unleſſe ſhee would declare her of-ſpring, But ſhee having uttered forth ſorrowfull things, to have vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away, and alſo to have drowned this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1726:113"/>
childe, waſhing himſelfe in the Sea, being growne to ripeneſſe of age, and that hee was afterward found in no place caſt out to the ſhore ſide. Therefore that hee was not a true man, although he was borne and brought up in ſhape of a true man. Moreover, that many did believe, that this ſpirit, which, by a falſe apparition did ſeeme to be a woman,<note place="margin">The Divell named <hi>Succu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
                  </note> to be a divell, which is named <hi>Succubus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not unlike to this, which hee bringeth forth in the aforeſaid place, Namely, that at <hi>Colonia Agrippina,</hi> many Noble men ſate in Councell in a certaine Palace, ſometime neere the ſhore of the river <hi>Rhenus,</hi> which while by chance they did looke downe into the water, did ſee a certaine ſouldier carried in a little boat, a Swanne ſwimming before, drawing the little boat with a ſilver chaine put upon his neck, ſuddenly to leap upon the ſhore, the Swan being ſent away with the little boat, there to have married a wife, and to have begotten ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children of her. And ſome yeeres being ended, the empty boat ſwimming backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and the Swanne ſwimming before it, as hee did before time, that the ſame ſouldier did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1726:114"/>
returne againe into the ſame boat, and to have appeared to no man againe, and that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lived there a long time. But many have believed that he was a Divel, whom they named <hi>Incubus,</hi> who dwelling ſo long with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo many yeeres in the ſhape of a man, having uſed ſuch great coozenages and deceits, did ſhew forth counterfeited tumours of her wombe, and counterfeited births, children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed underneath, taken by ſtealth from ſome other place.<note place="margin">Whether the Divell may conceive ſeed of men, and by the ſame ſeed caſt forth into women, ingender, or not.</note> But whereas many doe labour by this perſwaſion, and contend, that the Divell, named <hi>Succubus,</hi> may be able to conceive ſeede from man, and by and by being changed into a Divell, named <hi>Incubus,</hi> to caſt forth the ſame ſeede into the wombe of a woman, and of her to ingender a man; as it is moſt falſe, ſo it ought to deſerve no credit at all. For it is moſt contrary and repugnant both to Religion, and alſo to Nature: For if this were poſſible, with how many monſters of wilde beaſts had wee ſeene mankinde, ſo long ſpace of time to have beene tormented and vexed of ſuch a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, by the change and alteration of ſeeds made in brute beaſts, men and women.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1726:114"/>Wherefore <hi>Conciliator</hi> in his Booke <hi>de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi> the twenty and fifth Difference, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth well of theſe things, ſaying, Wee muſt know, that the teſticles or ſtones of man, are the principall parts of the generative or beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vertues, but not the ſole or onely parts, becauſe the beginning of Generation is not cauſed by them alone, neither are they alone able to perfect Generation: For the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is from the heart, by reaſon of vitall and lively faculty and vertue repoſed and laid up in the ſame, ſo that no living thing can be ingendered without the helpe and aid of the power and vertue of it: For at laſt the vertue and faculty of the teſticles, doe conſiſt by vitall vertue, and naturall heat. Wherefore, that the Divell, named in Latine, <hi>Succubus,</hi> may be able to conceive with men, and being changed into the Divell, termed <hi>Incubus,</hi> may caſt forth the ſame ſeede conceived into women, and beget a man, is not only a fabulous thing to be ſpoken, but alſo impious, wicked, and odious to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>But whether the Divell hath power to ſteale, to carry, from one place to another, to convey
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1726:115"/>
and change children one for another, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that needeth no great enquiry. For that ſome ſuch like thing may be brought to paſſe ſome time, wee muſt underſtand; but that it is not done by his owne power, but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the moſt juſt and omnipotent God for the ſinnes of men, eſpecially when wicked Parents, having no religious care of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, do not ſtrengthen and fortifie them with the bleſſing of God, and overwhelme them with the curſe of the Divell. Therefore let all, becauſe they are the children of God, learne to bring them up religiouſly, and to conſecrate them to God, and not to object them to the maledictions of the Divell.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee ſay, that ſterility or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, of which wee have purpoſed to ſpeak at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is not onely a diſability and unaptneſſe of bringing forth children in women, contracted and cauſed by ſome cauſe that may be corrected and remedied: but in men alſo of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1726:116"/>
ingendering and ſending forth fruitfull ſeede. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributeth this diſability and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency principally to fat men and women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evill proportion, and ill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the generative members, that is to ſay, in whom the ſeed is procured and derived from a more remote place, and ſo vitall ſpirit inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it doth vaniſh away ſooner by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. But not onely that habite and diſpoſition of the body is a cauſe, but there are many other cauſes alſo beſides of this difficulty and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: For when we ſee oftentimes man and wife joyned together, not to ingender and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get children: but being ſeparated both of them to procreate children: and on the contrary part, that thoſe, which being coupled together, doe beget children, are not fruitfull when they are ſeparated, it muſt needes be that without doubt there is ſome hidden cauſe. Where wee thinke it will not be an unprofitable thing to declare and bring forth thoſe things which are beſt knowne: For there are many outward and inward cauſes, which doe concurre together in this caſe.</p>
               <p>But as fertility and fruitfulneſſe hath his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1726:116"/>
helpes and furtherances by many outward things, as in a convenient diet, in an accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med temperature of the aire, by bathes warme by nature, ſuch as are the Helvetian and Valle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian bathes, with the waters of <hi>Embs:</hi> ſo alſo ſterility and difficulty of ingendring have very great help and ſuccour by them, whereby they are cauſed and increaſed, as by an unconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diet, by the permutation and change of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed aire, by drinking of the water of Ice, and by bathes. Further, barrenneſſe may be judged to proceede from the diſpoſition and quality of the generative members: For it commeth to paſſe, that not a few infirmities and grievances doe happen to them, by reaſon of which man and wife are not onely made impotent and barren, but are unfit to dwell together; huſbands with their wives, and wives with their huſbands. In which place the ſtrictneſſe and narrowneſſe of the mouth of the Matrix doth very much diſprofit and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, by which it falleth out, that not only the Termes, being ſtopped, doe let and hinder ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but moreover, alſo doe breed and bring forth very many other evills. Againe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1726:117"/>
when the ſecrets themſelves are too wide or too ſtrait, and therefore are not convenient, neither for conception nor generation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſtaying of the Termes cauſeth the ſame thing, which doth much diſtemper and moleſt the Matrix, and ſuffocateth and choketh the ſeede caſt forth into the wombe through abundance of evill humours. Among women alſo, they which are over man-like, are not ſo apt for generation: and among men, thoſe which are more effeminate and woman-like than is requiſite; For theſe women almoſt univerſally, doe want the iſſuing forth of the Termes at their due ſeaſons, and alſo the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing humours: And ſuch men being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperatly cold and moiſt, cannot ſend forth ſeed poſſeſſed with a generative vertue. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pertaineth both the weake and feeble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive power of the Matrix, and alſo the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alteration of the ſame. For the attractive and expulſive vertue of the Matrix, either too ſtrong or weake, doe equally cauſe the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ingendering. Likewiſe the maladies of the Matrix, tumours, inflammations, ulcers, Apoſtemes, the mouths of the veines, named,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1726:117"/>
                  <hi>Acetabula,</hi> being broken, the Termes iſſuing forth immoderately, or ſtopped, and ſuch like things doe afford and miniſter great occaſion to the ſame difficulty. Many alſo ſay, the veines placed behinde the eares (to wit which give way to the ſpirits, which the braine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth and imparteth to the ſeed) being cut aſunder, to be a cauſe to the ſame difficulty and debility of ingendering, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth. They affirme, that the inciſion of the bladder doth bring the ſame, which of it ſelfe it is deadly: There are alſo many things, which being taken, doe properly procure ſterility and barrenneſſe, as Camphire, Hemlocke, and other herbes and roots like unto theſe, and all things which offend and hurt the braine, kidnies, and teſticles, being the principall members of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
               <p>Hitherto alſo belongeth many other things,<note place="margin">Externall cauſes.</note> as over much repletion, emptineſſe, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſes, intemperate heat, deadly cold: Likewiſe <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> doth attribute a certaine peculiar force to ſome waters, to cauſe ſterili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the moſt part, diverſity of complexions hath the ſuperiority among the cauſes, when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1726:118"/>
man and wife doe want the due temperature of the qualities. But where they ſhall be mixed, yea, but little, they ſhall be able to ingender more eaſily: Old age alſo of it ſelfe in men and women, doth hinder generation through the defect of humours, although it be found by experience, as yet, that many men being three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten, or foure-ſcore yeeres of age, have begotten children. Laſtly, there is alſo a great cauſe of ſterility, which happeneth by the witchcraft of Witches. Let it ſuffice to have ſpoken theſe things concerning the evident and knowne cauſes of barrenneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe.</note>Moreover, there are many ſignes whereby the difficulty of conceiving or begetting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be noted and obſerved. The firſt are to be taken from the conſtitution and habit of the privie members, as if they be diſeaſed with any corruption or defect, or be too large, or too ſtrait and narrow, they are knowne not to be apt and fit for generation. The ſeed alſo is unfit, if it be too hot, or too cold, which thing they ſay may not onely be obſerved by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the urine, but alſo of the ſubſtance of the ſame. Alſo many judge of ſterility and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1726:118"/>
fruitfulneſſe by the habite and colour of the body, that the women which are of a pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour are ſuppoſed to be alſo more moiſt than others. If they be more moiſt, they are not ſo apt to retaine and cheeriſh the ſeed. This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment following is put in practice of ſome: When they goe about to make a triall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the unfruitfulneſſe or fertility of any one, they poure the urine of the party on Barley. If this ſprout out within tenne daies, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it for a ſigne of fruitfulneſſe: if it doe not, they acknowledge it for a certaine argument of ſterility and barrenneſſe: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pouring the urine upon Huskes, or Bran, if they ſee wormes to be bred and ingendered in it, doe obſerve a ſigne of barrenneſſe from that. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth counſell us to ſearch out this thing by fumes made underneath, ſo that if a fume being uſed underneath, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived above by ſmelling, the woman being cloſe covered about the lower parts, then, hee ſaith, it may be thought to be a ſigne of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, becauſe the ſecret members are not ſtrict and narrow: If it be not perceived by ſmelling at the noſtrills, he ſaith, it is a very
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1726:119"/>
certaine note and ſigne of the ſtrictneſſe and narrowneſſe of the Matrix, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of barrenneſſe. Some would have the ſame thing to be found out by annoynting the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the eyes with liquid oyntments, ſo that if the oyntments of ſome kindes of colours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid upon the corners of the eyes doe not change the colour of the ſpittle, then it ſhould be a ſigne of conſtipation and ſtopping, and therefore of barrenneſſe alſo, becauſe the eyes are members communicating with the ſeede, becauſe they quickely ſinke downe and waxe hollow when it is immoderatly ſent forth and diſperſed. Some old women likewiſe have their ſignes by which they obſerve whether the greater ſterility or unfruitfulneſſe be in the husband, or in his wife; for they ſprinkle two hand fulls of Sage, laid ſeverally by themſelves, with urine, one of them with the urine of the man, and the other with the urine of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and they ſay, that the handfull which ſhall wither firſt, is a teſtimony of barrenneſſe of the party, with whoſe urine it was ſprinkled and watered. They receive the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo by Beanes and Barley, that whoſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1726:119"/>
part doth ſprout firſt, in him or her, they thinke there is moſt fertility and fruitfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Further, wee muſt conſider here alſo, that fruitfull women, and ſuch as are apt to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der children, doe ſooner ſeeme to be old in the outward habite of body, than thoſe which are barren and fruitleſſe, alſo they waxe leane ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and become weake, notwithſtanding they live more healthfull in their old age, than they which never ingendered any children, becauſe in theſe the abundance of divers humours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſtopped, hath bred ſome worſe thing, and hath given greater occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the temperate health of the body.</p>

Diſſolve all theſe things with the juyce or water of Mugwoort, and after they have beene infuſed in it ſome houres, let them be ſtrained, and let a confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made in little rundells, or Trochiskes. Let the Doſis or quantity to be taken, bee

halfe an ounce, or five drams: Or if you pleaſe you ſhall take of the powders, and ſhall mingle them with white Sugar in equall weight, and ſhall make a mixture of them (properly named Tragaea) of which you ſhall give one dram and a halfe in broth of Cicers very warme. Some doe give the leaves of Sena beaten to powder two drams and a halfe after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But theſe purging medicines are to be tempered by the counſell of skilfull Phyſitians, according to the qualities of thoſe things, for which they are given.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch kind of matter being ſufficiently purged, the next thing ſhall be, that the uſe of bathes doe follow, and ſo often as the woman ſhall come out of them, let her take one dram of common Triackle or Mithridate, in water of Mugwoort; Or if it like you better, let her take a little of this confection following: Take of the Species or kindes of Triphera magna without Opium, Diapliris, Diambra, Diamuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Diaſatyrion, of each halfe a dram; ſcraping of Ivory, ſeed of the herbe of Mercury, of each two ſcruples; the Runnet of a Hare and Matrix of it, of each halfe a dram, Siſely halfe a ſcruple,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1726:122"/>
white Sugar halfe a pound. Let them be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Bawme-water, and let there be added to them being orderly boiled; Conſerve of the rinds of the Citron one ounce, and conſerve of Roſemary-flowers halfe an ounce; Let there be a confection made ſomewhat thicke.</p>
               <p>But let her chiefeſt care be while ſhee doth uſe bathes, that ſhe uſe a certaine &amp; convenient diet, and moderate feeding, which alwaies muſt be preſcribed and appointed of a skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian.</p>
               <p>But if the woman cannot have ſuch natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bathes, a bathe may be prepared for her of theſe herbes following ſodden in water.</p>
               <p>Take Mugwoort, Betony, Chamaepitis, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Celandine, Clary, Bay-leaves, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, Feverfew, Bawme, wilde Penniroyall, Origanum, Ozimus, Penniroyall, Roſe-mary, Savine, Melilote, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1726:123"/>
all of them being mingled together, be put in a bag, and let them boile in water. And alwaies every fourth day this bathe muſt be renewed againe. As often as ſhee ſhall leave bathing, let her take of comon Triacle, or Mithridate, as is ſpoken before; let her lie downe in her bed, and let her provoke ſweating, if ſhe can by any meanes: Or let her uſe the confection before deſcribed, morning and evening in the ſame manner. But when it ſhall not ſeeme commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to uſe this bathe, ſome of the aforeſaid herbes may be gathered, and fomentations may be made of them.</p>
               <p>But when all theſe things ſhall not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purge the Phlegmaticke humour, it ſhall be profitable to miniſter a peſſarie to her every night prepared in this manner: and let her uſe it untill ſhe ſhall feele her ſelfe freed from thoſe ſuperfluous Phlegmatick humours.</p>
               <p>Take Mugwoort, Savine, Marjoram, Ditta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Wormewood, of each halfe a dram; Aniſe, Rue, the rind or outſide of Frankincenſe, of each one ſcruple, the pulpe of Colocynthis two ſcruples. Make a powder of them, and let it be tempered and incorporated with the juyce
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1726:123"/>
of the herbe Mercurie or Germander, and make a Peſſarie.</p>
               <p>Further, among all the medicines which bind the Matrix, wee thinke that nothing can be better approved than this following. Take Acacia, Balauſtium, or the flowers of Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, Akorne cups, the droſſe or ſcales of Iron, Mints, Lillies, barke of the Maſtick-tree or Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcus, the outſide of Olibanum, Anthera, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Tartar, Spike, of each halfe a dram; mingle them, and make a powder of them, of which, with the juyce of Sorrell, or Fullers teaſell, named in latine <hi>Virga Paſtoris,</hi> or with the juyce of Milfoile or Yarrow, let Peſſaries be made.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſometimes it commeth to paſſe, that by reaſon of cold and moiſt Phlegme,<note place="margin">How the ill-ſavour of the Matrix is to be cured.</note> the Matrix cannot onely retaine and hold the ſeed, but alſo doth offend with a noiſome ſtinch and ſavour, therefore when this chanceth, we muſt uſe this medicine following. Take Galls, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, of each three drams, Cloves one dram, Muske halfe a ſcruple, let them be beaten to powder, and diſſolved with one pound of red Wine. When the woman will uſe theſe things,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1726:124"/>
let her waſh her ſecrets well with them, and lay clothes being dipped therein upon them, but let her doe it eſpecially when ſhe goeth to bed.</p>
               <p>But if it pleaſeth to uſe a more forcible me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to reſtraine and binde the Matrix, you may then uſe this following. Take the root of Comfrey, Allome, Balauſtium, Myrrhe, Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Maſtick, Colophony, Bole-Armeny, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe-nuts, Harts-horne burnt, of each one dram and a halfe.</p>

Let the woman waſh and bathe her ſecrets, with that decoction being very warme. Likewiſe ſhee may ſprinckle the dry powder upon them, and alſo lay a cloth doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led once or twice upon, being dipped and moiſtned before in that decoction. But if this ſhall profit nothing, or little, you muſt uſe alſo this Peſſarie beſides prepared after this manner.</p>
               <p>Take Allom, named in latin <hi>Allumen Sciſſile,</hi> Myrrh, Lignum Aloes, the haires of a Hare cut into ſmall pieces, Rue or Herb-grace, Bayber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Doronicum, Cypreſſe-nuts, of each halfe

               <p>BVt becauſe ſterility and barrenneſſe is not only ingendered of Phlegme and Choler abounding, but is alſo bred of overmuch blood, and ſometimes alſo other ſuperfluous or corrupt humours are mixed with the ſame; we muſt firſt ſee by the ſignes of Vrine, which of thoſe humours doe abound. If you ſhall finde that blood alone is abounding, then ſuch a diet ſhall be appointed, which may diminiſh blood, and miniſter ſmall nouriſhment unto to it. If you ſhall perceive cholericke humour to be in it, you ſhall order your diet to a cold temperature. If Phlegme ſhall abound in it, you ſhall direct the temperature of your diet to drineſſe. For it ſhall come to paſſe, that that ſuperfluitie, of what humour ſoever it ſhall be, may by little and little be prepared for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient purgation. But becauſe the meanes is not commonly knowne to purge blood from thoſe aforeſaid humours, when it is mixed with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1726:128"/>
them, it is to be inquired for of skilfull Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: we will only proſecute that in this place, which pertaineth to the diminiſhing of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and ſuperfluity of bloody humours.</p>
               <p>Therefore when it is knowne and evident that abundance of blood doth hinder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in women, let firſt the veines of the Anckle be opened in both the feete, and let a juſt quantity of blood be taken away. Which done, a bathe ſhall be prepared of ſuch herbs as doe incline to cooling and refrigeration. After the bath, the woman ought to uſe theſe Lozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or little Cakes. Take Cinamome, ſeede of Mercury, red Roſes, Scrapings, Pearles prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, of each one dram: red Corrall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, powder of precious Stones, of each two ſcruples, all the ſorts of Sanders halfe a dram, Sugar halfe a pound.</p>
               <p>Let the Sugar be diſſolved in Roſe-water, and let all things be decocted and boiled, untill the Roſe-water be waſted away: which being done, let one ounce of conſerve of Roſes be added to it, and all things being mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let gilded Lozenges or little Roundells be made in ſuch ſort as they ought to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1726:128"/>Likewiſe an Electuary very commodious profitable for this uſe, may be prepared in this manner, of which let her take the quantity of a Filberd-nut alwaies before meat. Take of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes one ounce, of Bugloſſe, Borrage, of each two drams, of the ſpecies or ſimples of Diatriaſandali, of Diarhodon Abbatis, of each three drams. Let theſe Ingredients be tempered together with ſyrup of Roſes, and let them all be incorporated together, and let them be gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the leaves of Gold, ſo much as may ſuffice, and let an Electuarie be made of them. Alſo it ſhall be a profitable thing, that ſhee ſhould be bathed with a decoction made with theſe Simples following, made in raine-water, or in water wherein ſteele hath beene often quenched. Take red Roſes, Galls, Sumach, the ſeed of the greater Plantane, with the leaves, Comfrey, of each halfe a handfull, Terra Sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata, Bole Armeniacke, Roch Allome, of each halfe an ounce.</p>

               <p>It is alſo exceeding profitable to drinke Goats-milke newly milked with Hony or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mixed with it. Likewiſe this bathe is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull convenient. Take Heads of Weathers, and let them be ſodden in a Kettle full of water, ſo long till the fleſh be looſed and part quite from the bones, which being done, Take moreover the leaves of Vine, named, Vitis Muſcatella, of the Willow tree, Violet-leaves, Camomel, Melilot, of each two handfuls Mariſh Mallowes with the roots, ſix handfuls, Fenegrec, Line-ſeed, of each two pound, roots of Valerian one pound and a halfe: let all things be mingled together, and let a bathe be made of them being ſufficiently boiled. And it may be prepared ſo, that either the woman may ſit in it, or make Fomentations of it. But after the bathe or Fomentations, ſhe may take a little morſell of this confection the next houres after meate. Take of the Species
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1726:132"/>
of Diarhodon Abbatis, two drams, ſeede of Mercury, ſcrapings of Ivorie, of each two ſcruples, the Matrix of a Hare two drams, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-ſeed, Tragacantha, Gumme Arabicke, of each halfe a dram, white Sugar halfe a pound diſſolved in water of Bugloſſe, conſerve of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſſe, Borrage, of each one ounce; mixe them, and let a gilded confection be made.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially it ſhall be needfull to moiſten the Matrix, which ſhall partly be done by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations uſed underneath in a chaire inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and covered round about, and partly by Peſſaries being thus prepared. Take Marrow of the leg of a Cow, Greaſe of a Henne, of each halfe an ounce, Styrax liquida two drams. Alſo foure ounces of oile of ſweete Almonds may be added to them, and let Peſſaries be made with cleane wooll.</p>
               <p>But if conception be hindered through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate hear, that either the body is of an over-hot complexion, or the ſecret parts are moleſted with intemperate heat: Firſt of all, this heat ſhall be diminiſhed by a convenient launcing and opening of the veines, the Ankle-veines in the left foot, and the Liver-veines in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1726:132"/>
the right foot. Afterward purgations muſt be uſed, ſo much as reaſon ſhall require; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them this Potion ſhall be taken for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative of the hot humours: Take herbes of Plantane the greater, Endive, Venus-haire, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipodie, Fumirary, of each halfe a handfull; red Roſes, Violet-flowers, Bugloſſe, Water-Lillies, Borrage, of each a little quantity, named a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, Raiſins halfe an ounce.</p>
               <p>Let all of them mixed together be boiled in running-water, let one halfe be conſumed and waſted, let them be ſtrained, and to the ſtraining, let there be added a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of white Sugar, and let it be made aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call with Cinamome, ſcrapings of Ivory, red Corall prepared, red Sanders, of each halfe a dram: Take three ounces of the aforeſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and let them be tempered with two ſcruples of Choyſe Rhubarb powdred, with ſyrup of Epithymie halfe an ounce, Caſſia new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne one dram and a halfe, or Manna one dram: Or otherwiſe, Take of the Electuary <hi>de Succo Roſarum,</hi> three drams, Caſſia newly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, Diaſena, of each two drams; Temper them with an ounce and a halfe of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid

Peſſaries alſo may be prepared, and be applied underneath, compounded with the juyce of Mandrake, Maſtick, Myrrh, Camphire, and Gum Arabick. But if the heat do not exceed, but ſhall be more temperate, then that which aboundeth, ſhall be diminiſhed with Plaiſters laid upon the Navell and ſecret members, as with Vnguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Santalinum, decocted in a liquid and thick forme. In few words, wee may proceed in the ſame order as wee have preſcribed concerning choler and blood.</p>
               <p>But if coldneſſe and moiſtneſſe ſhall moleſt and vexe the ſecret parts over-much: Firſt the ſuperfluity of them ſhall be mollified and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for purgation, by remedies declining from them to heat and drineſſe according to the preſcript of the ſyrup following: Take of the herbes of Mugwoort, Betony, Bawme,

Penny-royall, Marjoram, of each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, roots of Enula Campana, Galangal, Saytri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Parſley, Fennel, Aſarum, of each two drams, Aniſ-ſeed, Amomum, Liquorice, Madder that Diers doe uſe, wilde Carrot, Siler montanum, Cummine, of each one dramme, Raiſins one ounce, Fountaine-water ſo much as ſufficeth, of Sugar, or clarified Hony a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let them all be commixed, and after the ſtraining made, let them be made odoriferous with Cinamome, and let Oxymel ſquilliticum be added to it. Take three ounces at a time: Or elſe, take Electuarium Indum one ounce, Catharticum Imperiale halfe an ounce, waters of Bugloſſe and Borrage, of each one ounce; temper them together, and make a draught; Or diſſolve them with three ounces of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid decoction, and in like manner make one draught. There may alſo be uſe here of Pilulae Foetidae, and of Pills confected of Rheubarb. Purgation ſufficiently made, let her take Pills prepared in this manner the quantity of a dram, when ſhee is about to goe to bed. Take Lignum Aloes, Xylobalſamum, Siler mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Aſarum, or Aſara Bacca, Maſticke, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megge,

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of certaine generall Precepts ſerving for the curing of the barrenneſſe of men and women.</head>
               <p>A Great part of the Cure of the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men and women, conſiſteth in the uſe of exeternall things: which by our advice muſt be moderate, that the body doe not become groſſe and fat, becauſe fatneſſe doth very much hinder ſecundity and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Alſo extreme leaneſſe cannot be without fault in this caſe. Wherefore in both theſe, they muſt uſe temperate nouriſhments, which have not the Nature to inflate and to breed windy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1726:134"/>
matter in the body. They muſt uſe Wine but little, and ſparing and moderate meate. But principally, let women obſerve and conſider the complexion and ſtate of the Matrix, and let them warily marke their Termes, leſt in the time when they iſſue forth, or when they are cleared from them, they uſe an inconvenient diet, but that rather they uſe moſt eſpecially ſuch things which are knowne to have an expulſive vertue and force to expell out of the body: ſuch as are parſley, Stone-parſley, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, the herbe which the Germans call com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Pimpinella, with the like herbes and roots of the ſame nature and quality. But that every one may be inſtructed concerning every caſe, wee will give an Antidote and Medicine contrary to the complexion of every corrupted Matrix.</p>
               <p>And verily firſt of all, when the Matrix ſhall be diſtempered, and troubled with immoderate coldneſſe, there is cauſed a ſtopping of the Flowers, bred and ingendred by reaſon of an evill diet obſerved in meat and drinke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by continuall paines are felt about the loynes, kidnies, ſecrets along the backe, and other
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1726:135"/>
members of the body, and ever and anon horrible cold doth vex and moleſt them. When things are come to this paſſe, the uſe of thoſe things is profitable, whatſoever are of a hot Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſpecially hot baths abounding with Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, ſuch as are the bathes of the <hi>Helvetians</hi> or <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> eſpecially named the bathes of <hi>Badena</hi> (a City in <hi>Helvetia</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But it ſhall be very profitable to uſe this ſyrup or potion for a preparative of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet to be purged. Take of the ſyrup of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woort, on ounce, Oxymel compound, halfe an ounce, waters of Mugwoort and Bawme, of each one ounce. By mixing them together, make one draught: But this drinke following muſt be uſed for a purgation. Take Benedicta Laxativa, Caſſia newly extracted, of each three drams, water of Penny-royall, and Mugwoort one ounce and a halfe, mingle them, and let one draught be made. Alſo the confection of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtoreum is approved for this uſe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe all their meats are to be ſeaſoned with theſe ſpices, which have the Nature to heat, as with Peper, Ginger, and ſuch like. To be ſhort, they muſt proceed in the ſame order
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1726:135"/>
as wee have taught before in curing ſterility comming from a phlegmaticke humour.</p>
               <p>Further, if the Matrix ſhall be grieved with intemperate heat and drineſſe, the Termes will iſſue forth often, but ſo ſharpe, that often times the ſecret parts are diſeaſed and exulcerated. In this caſe the diet, medicines, and uſe of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things is to be reduced, and brought to a cold and moiſt temperature, as it is in like manner declared before, in the Cure of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe proceeding from ſuperfluity of choler.</p>
               <p>But becauſe oftentimes conception is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of wind incloſed within the body, they muſt uſe meate and drinke, which doth not puffe up and breed wind in the body, but ſuch as doth diſſipate and diſperſe the ſame, and proceed in the ſame order, as we have taught before in curing the falſe windy conception, named Mola. And let theſe things be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoken, concerning thoſe things which rectifie and remedy barrenneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now in this diſcourſe thoſe things are not to be omitted,<note place="margin">Helps of frut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</note> which further and cauſe fecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fruitfulneſſe. In this behalfe many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent profitable things are delivered of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1726:136"/>
ancient and latter Phyſicians, of which thoſe which are chiefeſt, we have thought it a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing to gather together, and to publiſh abroad to the profit and commodity of many.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Suffumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Theſe Fumes firſt made upon the coales, and directed to the Matrix doe pleaſe very many.</p>
               <p>Take Cypreſſe-nuts, Nutmegge, Maſticke, Frankincenſe, Ladanum, Myrrh, Galbanum, Bdellium, Bay-berries of each one dram, Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax-calamita, Styrax liquida of each two ſcruples, Cloves, Carui, of each halfe a dram, Amber two graines, Saffron one ſcruple, Muske five graines.</p>
               <p>Let all theſe things be mingled together with oile of odoriferous Spike, and let Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiskes be made of them, with the which let the woman in the morning, being faſting, and in the evening, about to goe to bed, receive a fume underneath.</p>
               <p>Alſo it will be profitable, to annoint the privie parts with this unguentum following:<note place="margin">An Vnguent.</note> Take Styrax Calamita one dramme, Saffron, Maſticke, Ladanum, Myrrh, of each one dram, Temper them with oyle of Spike and Roſes and white Waxe ſo much as may ſuffice, and a

Liniment be made: Likewiſe the braines roſted of Hares will do good in this caſe. But ſome do uſe the greaſe of Duckes, Geeſe, Hennes, Harts, and the like, to which they doe mixe the ſorts of ſimples before preſcribed, and make Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiskes convenient to make a Suffumigation. Likewiſe you may uſe theſe fumes following:<note place="margin">Suffumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Take Pure Ladanum one ounce, Styrax Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mita, Olibanum, of each one dram; Lignum Aloes, dry Savine, of each one dram and a halfe; Amber three graines, Muske ſix graines; Let all theſe things be mixed and beaten to powder, and let Trochisks be made with a hot Peſtle, of which being caſt upon the coales, let a fume be made underneath thorow a Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell: Likewiſe Peſſaries may be made of the Maſſe or Lumpe of them; Or otherwiſe, Take Ladanum one dram, Styrax Calamita, halfe an ounce, Cloves, Lignum Aloes, red Roſes, of each two drams, Amber halfe a ſcruple, Muske ſixe graines; let all theſe things be pounded, and let Trochiskes be made of them in the manner aforeſaid. Some of theſe alſo may be diſſolved with Roſe-water, and the mouth of the Matrix may be waſhed with it. Of theſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1726:137"/>
alſo Peſſaries may be prepared. Here is alſo another thing very profitable: Take red Roſes halfe an ounce, Frankincenſe, Maſticke Myrrh, Sanguis Draconis, Bole-Armeniacke, Myrtles, of each two drams, Styrax Calamita halfe an ounce, Ladanum halfe an ounce, Amber, Muske, Lignum Aloes, Cloves, Artificiall Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamum, Spick-Nard, of each halfe a ſcruple. Thoſe things that are to be powdred, let them be beaten to powder, and let Trochiskes be made in the aforeſaid manner, and let a Suffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation be made thorow a Tunnell with one dram of it. It hath beene received for a truth of ſome acient Writers, that women, which did often eate the roots of Ariſtolochia with roſted Veale, ſhould almoſt certainely conceive male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidren.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Peſſaries.</note>But many of the later Phyſicians doe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to apply theſe Peſſaries underneath, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day after the iſſuing forth of the Flowers for to rectifie conception. Take of the root of Gentian, Saffron, Myrtles, Aloes, of each two drams; Line-ſeede Oyle, ſo much as ſufficeth. And let a Peſſarie be made with them, which they ſay, will cauſe Conception within a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1726:137"/>
few daies after it hath beene uſed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Galen</hi> counſelleth to drinke Caſtoreum which is new, and any kind of Peper taken the weight of twelve Barley cornes in Malmeſey, being mixed with the juyce of Penny-royall. The ſame <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that the Matrix of a Hare being dryed and beaten to powder, taken in Malmeſey to be approved of ſome: But it is certaine, that the Fumes or Suffumigations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed, to be moſt approved of many later Phyſicians: Alſo while wee make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe things, wee deſire that all men ſhould know, that wee have nothing to doe with the Sorceries and divelliſh Arts of ſome old Witches, concerning this matter. But let it ſuffice to have ſpoken hitherto of thoſe things, by which ſterility may be averted, and fruitfulneſſe furthered.</p>
               <p>It remaineth alſo to ſpeake a few words of thoſe things which are to be miniſtred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.<note place="margin">Inward helps of fruitfulneſſe.</note> For becauſe the fruitfulneſſe of man and wife may be hindred very much for want of deſire to be acquainted with Venus, and by impotency and diſability of ingendring and effecting Conception, and alſo by infirmity
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1726:138"/>
of the ſeeds, cauſed either by the defect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by the inchantments of evill arts: Wee will declare how all theſe things are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the preſcript formes of theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines following: But firſt let ſuch a powder be made profitable and commodious for this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A powder.</note>Take the ſtones of a Foxe, Caſtoreum, the Matrix of a Hare, dryed, of each two drams: Galangal, Long-peper, of each two drams; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar equall to all in weight. Mix them, and make a powder, of which one ſpoonefull is to be taken every day, morning and evening with Malmeſey.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An Electuary.</note>Alſo an Electuary very much approved, is very profitable for men and women, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every day in the morning faſting, and in the evening when they are about to goe to bed, the weight of a Filberd-nut, ſhall be prepared in this manner: Take the Teſticles or ſtones of a Foxe cleanſed ſix ounces, red Cicers, Mints, Satyrion, wild Rocket, the roote of Acorus, wilde Carrot, the root of Gladiolus, or Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe, Bawme, Creſſes, Ozimus, Penny-royall, Vrtica, Fennell, of each two ounces.</p>

               <p>THe Precipitation of the Matrix, is the departure and digreſſion of the Matrix from her naturall place into ſome other place, or the comming forth and outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of it through the privities.</p>
               <p>This hapneth either by a fall, blow, or ſome other vehement hurt, or through wind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the Matrix, or corrupt humours, or by the intemperate moiſtneſſe putrefying the ligaments and binders of the ſame, or elſe through difficulty and painfulneſſe of Aborce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1726:144"/>
or the birth and negligence of Midwives, or by violent extraction and pulling forth of the Secundine, whereby it falleth out, that the ligaments and ſtay-bands of it are broken, and the Matrix is throwne downe ſuddenly to iſſue forth. This removing of the Matrix is cauſed in a diverſe manner, that is to ſay, toward the right or left ſide, or lower, and into the fore-part and hinder part of the body.</p>
               <p>But although the cauſes of theſe diſeaſes may eaſily be judged and diſcerned by theſe things going before, yet they may as yet be divided into outward and inward. Outward cauſes are,<note place="margin">Outward Cauſes.</note> falling, blowes or ſtrokes, ſome hurt, lifting of ſome thing which is of great waight, ſwift run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leaping, dauncing, unſeaſonable riding, all immoderate exerciſe, and ſuch things as are like unto them. Alſo long ſitting upon the cold earth or cold pavement, long-tarrying in cold water, over-much and often drinking of cold water: Alſo the violent breaking forth of the child, the hard and painfull birth, the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Midwives, the violent extraction of the Secundine, often coughing, great crying out, vehement ſneeſing.

The ſignes of this diſeaſe are not unlike to the cauſes:<note place="margin">Signes.</note> The party will eaſily rehearſe the ſignes of the outward cauſes, Whoſoever is grieved with this diſeaſe; But the inward ſignes are to be conſidered according unto the removing of the Matrix: For if it bend toward Diaphragma, or the Midriffe, without any ſtrangling or choking, wee may perceive that the woman doth feele paines, and heaving above the Navell, to feele a round lumpe like a Globe in her belly, to fetch her breath and wind very ſhort and quicke, as though her bowells were ſwiftly cruſhed together with the hand, a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1726:145"/>
dimneſſe of the eyes, paine of the head, loathing of meat, and often belchings going before and accompanying it: ſometimes alſo a ſound of the belly being heard, eſpecially when as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from her place ſhall ariſe from wind incloſed in the ſame. But if it ſhall fall downe to the lower parts, then many paines ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the kidnies, loynes and ſecret members, and a round lumpe is felt in the necke of the Matrix, with which the Bladder and Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rectum, or the Fundament gut are ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together, that it is a hard and difficult thing for her to void her urine and other excrements, her urine alſo will be white and thick, blewiſh or blacke dregs gathered together in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, almoſt no pulſe at all, ſoft, ſlender, thicke and diſordered. But if by intemperate moiſture of the Matrix, the ligaments and ſtay-bands of it are putrefied and rotted, ſo that for that cauſe it falleth downe to iſſue forth, we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that this is cauſed without any paine; and when the caſe ſtandeth ſo, ſtinking and filthy corrupt matter doth iſſue out of the Matrix continually. If it happen by difficultie and hardneſſe of the birth, it will at all times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

out of the privities, but it will come forth being forced and conſtrained by great labours and exerciſes, and will ſtirre up great paines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the lips or brimes of the ſame, being preſſed together. Therefore all the qualities and conditions of this ſickeneſſe and malady are diligently to be marked and obſerved, that all things may goe forward the better in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the cure.</p>

Wherefore if the Matrix ſhall be removed upward, without any ſuffocation, it ſhall be able eaſily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and brought into her place againe with Fumes, Fomentations, or other things which have force to repell and drive backe, as it hath been made evident and manifeſt in the Tractat of the former Chapter, concerning the ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Matrix. But if it ſhall remove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the right ſide, Cupping-glaſſes are to be fixed on the contrary ſide without Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Alſo let there be binding-bands made of cloth folded together, a little bundle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

by the advice of ſome Phyſician of ſuch things, as have force to move the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, being put betweene thoſe bands.

And thoſe things bundled together, ſhall be Bawme, Camomile, Mugwoort, Melilot, Rue or herbe-Grace, and ſuch like things.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">A Powder.</note> ſhee muſt take one ſpoonfull of this powder following with wine very hot, her ſtomacke being as yet empty, every day in the morning. Take Flowers and Berries of the Bay-tree, Harts-horne burnt, of each two drams, Myrtles two ſcruples, Ariſtolochia ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunda one dram, Mingle them, and make a powder: Or otherwiſe, take Peach-kernells in number twelve, Diſſolve them with the yolkes of three Egs. Afterward take Cinamome, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Ariſtolochia rotunda, of each one dram, Dittany halfe a dram, Nutmegge one ſcruple, Saffron halfe a ſcruple, mingle them with Wine and Sugar, ſo much as ſufficeth, let a

               <p>But if it fall downeward, and appeare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the ſecrets, firſt, the excrements of the belly are to be moved to iſſue forth with a Clyſter conveniently, and likewiſe the Bladder is to be diſ-burdened, alſo the wombe is to be mollified with this bathe following,<note place="margin">A Bathe.</note> that the Matrix may have the more eaſie regreſſe and returne into her place: Take Mugwoort, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, both kindes of Mallowes, with the roots, Fenegrec, Bay-berries, of each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, mingle them together, and let a bathe be made of them.</p>
               <p>So often as ſhe ſhall come forth of the bathe, let the Matrix be cherriſhed with warme cloths, and let it be annoynted with the Muſcilage made of the Kernells of Quinces, mollified with the water of Acacia, that it may be ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her returne back.

And when it is reduced into her proper place, let her lie with her legs ſtretched out abroad, and let a large glaſſe, or more glaſſes be faſtened to her belly as ſhee lyeth, and let ſuch things as are of good and pleaſant ſmell and ſavour be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto her noſtrills, as Amber, and ſuch like things, that the Matrix may be drawne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the ſweetneſſe of the ſavour which it feeleth:<note place="margin">A Fume.</note> Alſo you ſhall make a Fume for her as ſhee lieth, which may onely attaine to her Matrix, but may in no wiſe come unto her noſtrills: Take of the juyce of Acacia, the bone of the Cuttle-fiſh, Pomegranat-flowers, roots of Biſtort, Galls, Cypreſſe-nuts, myrtles, or the leaves of each halfe an ounce, Maſticke,

               <p>But that the Matrix being reduced and brought into the wombe, may remaine and continue there, nor ſuddenly fall downe againe, it muſt be ſtrengthened according to theſe precepts and rules following: Firſt, let the woman lie a whole day upon her backe, after the reducing of the Matrix into her proper place.

Notwithſtanding, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth ſometime that Fluxes and iſſues are found to be in women conceived with childe every moneth, yet they are never the weaker by them, neither doe they ſubſtract or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw any nouriſhment from the Infant.</p>
               <p>Inward cauſes are to be judged and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Nature it ſelfe, or from the blood.<note place="margin">Internall Cauſes.</note> From Nature, when ſhee being ſtrong doth expell the blood, or being feeble and weake cannot hold or retaine it: For the blood, when it is too hot or ſharp, or over cold and thinne; againe, when by idleneſſe, immoderate meate and drinke, too much nouriſhment is afforded to the blood.</p>
               <p>Moreover, certaine ſignes doe happen,<note place="margin">Signes of the Cauſes.</note> by which it may certainly be found out, whether they come from an outward or inward cauſe.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1726:151"/>
If the Flux happen from an outward cauſe, as from a veine being broken through ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate exerciſe, by ſome hurt or fall, then the colour of the blood will be red at the firſt, but by and by blackiſh, or blacke. If it iſſue forth ſtraight-way it will appeare in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall colour, but being retained ſometime in the Matrix, it will iſſue forth with an ugly and thicke colour; if it ſhall remaine there long, it will be altogether full of corrupt matter. But if the blood ſhall iſſue forth becauſe of ulcers and ſores of the Matrix; Firſt, it will be cleare and thin, but by &amp; by it wil be ful of filthy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without all colour. If the ſtrong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty force of Nature doe expell it, then it will be done without paine, that alſo the body is alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated and eaſed by it, becauſe Nature voideth no more of that which is ingendred, but that which is ſuperfluous either in quality or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. If it ſhall happen by defect of retentive vertue, it will iſſue forth by drops, by little and little, and diſorderly, without any intermiſſion, and the woman which ſhall be affected and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with this iſſue, ſhall waxe pale, leane and very feeble in all her members, but the blood
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1726:151"/>
doth retaine ſtill his naturall colour, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad, it doth not burne, bite, or moleſt with any paines: But the cauſe of this Flux for the moſt part, doth happen to women, having paſſed beyond the fiftieth yeere, when as their Termes doe generally depart away. When it chanceth to young women, oftentimes it h p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth by vehement and grievous fits of a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Quartan Ague, and paines of the head: For theſe things doe diſſipate and drive away Naturall vertue and power, and do eaſily bring upon them ſuch a Flux and immoderate iſſue. If it proceed, and be cauſed by intemperate heate or acrimony and egerneſſe of the blood, the iſſue doth burne, bite, inflame, and corrode the entrance and mouth of the Matrix. The woman pained with this paſſion, doth endure intolerable thirſt, and her lips are grieved with chaps, bred and cauſed by moſt ſharpe and hot vapours of the blood fuming and ſteaming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Moſt grievous dolours and paines are felt in the niples of the Dugs, by reaſon of the affinity and fellowſhip that they have with the Matrix. The blood reſembleth the colour of Saffron, and is blacke; neither doth it iſſue
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1726:152"/>
forth copiouſly, although it be conſtrained. If it ariſe through ſubtility and thinneſſe of the blood, then the blood is pure and cleare, and the Flux is ſmall: If heate be mixed with it, it ſhall eaſily be diſcerned in the Matrix, and by other tokens and ſignes: If cold be mixed with it, it ſhall in like manner be obſerved and found out: If the blood ſhall iſſue forth, becauſe it is liquid and thin, the cauſe of this, is the evill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and ſtate of the body, and the debility of the concoctions, cauſed and ingendred by abundance of many moiſtures and winds, or vapors incloſed and impriſoned in the Matrix. But if you will have certaine knowledge of the humor conſtraining this unnaturall iſſue, looke upon a linnen cloth ſleightly coloured, and dipped in the menſtruous blood; If the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of it doth incline to redneſſe, you may know that the cauſe of the Fluxe doth proceed from blood: If it bend toward Citrine, or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour, from Choler; if it incline to white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from Phlegme: But if it incline to a black colour, you may know the cauſe of the Fluxe to ariſe from Melancholy.</p>

But if the contrary thing happen, it is to be reſtrained and ſtaied altogether, leſt it bring the Patient to cholerick Fevers, becauſe that blood being evacuated and exhauſted, Choler doth beare the whole ſway, and play the Tyrant, and being freed from his bridle doth furiouſly vex and torment the Patient: For blood, as it is commonly ſaid, is the bridle of Choler; But becauſe alſo naturall colour is nouriſhed &amp; cherriſhed with blood, that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, it is neceſſary that a defect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of heat muſt follow and enſue, and by that all the members and parts of the body to waxe cold, the whole body to be debilitated and weakened, the whole appetite to be taken away, the concoctions to be hindred, the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Hydropſie, and alſo other moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the the Cauſes and Cure of the ſtopping of the Termes.</head>
               <p>BVt becauſe in the former Chapter we have given inſtructions concerning the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Fluxes and iſſuings of the Termes and of the Cure of the ſame. The next thing is, that wee ſhould alſo ſpeake a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the retention and ſtopping of them: For thereby many ſickneſſes and diſeaſes are bred and ingendred, if they be detained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature, nor doe not iſſue forth in ſuch a quantity as they ſhould every Moone, in women well diſpoſed, in reſpect of age and conſtitution of body. And we muſt underſtand that this happeneth by outward and inward Cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Outward cauſes of the ſtopping of the Termes.</note>Externall cauſes are, the aire intemperately hot, cold and dry, meats over hot and binding, whereby the humours are burned, the body dried, and concoctions are hindred; alſo meats which are too cold congealing and freezing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1726:160"/>
(as it were) the reſt of the humours of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by their coldneſſe, and letting them from iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing forth by reſtraining and binding them. To theſe cauſes alſo theſe following doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, too much watching, immoderat faſting, every unſeaſonable and ſudden commotion or perturbation of the body, as great anger, ſudden fury, great ſadneſſe, great lamentation, over-much ſolitarineſſe, great labour, any great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſharp fits, a Quartane Fever, paine of the Head, the Fever Hecticke, too much fatneſſe, iſſuing forth of the blood of the noſtrils, or any other member, Vlcers and great Apoſtems.</p>
               <p>Inward cauſes,<note place="margin">Inward cauſes.</note> are partly bred by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome humour, and partly without the corruption of any humour: Cauſes without the corruption of the humour, are over-much heat, coldneſſe, and drineſſe: For to thoſe, which are cholericke, the humours are exſiccated and dried up through immoderate heat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Termes are ſtopped: But to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke,<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> the ſame thing happeneth by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate coldneſſe and drineſſe. But when they happen without the corruption of the humour, we muſt allege the qualities to be the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1726:161"/>
cauſe, and we may obſerve certaine ſignes from what quality they doe proceede, and againe, whether from a ſimple or a compound quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If they happen from coldneſſe and drineſſe, the iſſue of the Termes is little, the colour will be pale, no deſire of <hi>Venus,</hi> the urine thin, white, and without any convenient ſubſidence or grounds in the bottome. If they chance from hotneſſe and drineſſe, the Termes will be few, the colour redder, the greater deſire of <hi>Venus,</hi> the urine thinne, reddiſh, but almoſt no ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or dregs in the bottome of it. But for the moſt part this retention and ſtopping of the Termes,<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</note> doth happen by the corruption and fault of ſome humour, as of Phlegme, Choler and Melancholy, but not of blood at all, becauſe they are onely retained and ſtopped through the other humours bearing ſway in the blood.</p>
               <p>Moreover common ſignes, by which it is obſerved that the retention of the Termes is cauſed by the corruption of ſome humour, are theſe, namely, moſt great paines from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, even to the privities, and about the Kidnies, loynes, and hips continuall paines, but moſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1726:161"/>
often paines of the head, and alſo cold ſweats, many infirmities and griefes of the eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their affinity and fellowſhip with the Matrix, a painfull heavineſſe of the eye-lids, the colour pale, much ſadneſſe, often refuſing of meate, appetite ſlow, weakeneſſe of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and heavineſſe of the whole body: But here alſo concerning the quality of the humors very great differences are noted and obſerved, as ſhall be made manifeſt in the diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>If the cauſe be from Phlegme,<note place="margin">If the cauſe of the ſtopping of the Termes come from phlegme, what be the ſignes, and what be the cures.</note> the woman waxe pale, the eyes doe become blewiſh, the eye-browes doe ſwell, cold is felt in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Matrix, thick and ſtinking humors doe iſſue from it, white Termes doe drop from them, the vrine is plae, like unto Milke, thicke, and groſſe ſubſtance is found in the bottome. But where this cauſe ſhall be obſerved and found, firſt, the diet ſhall be directed and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a hot and dry temperature: Next that cold matter ſhall be mollified and prepared for purgation, with this ſyrup following: Take Chamaepitis, Germander, Origanum, Roſemary, Penny-royall, Savine, water-Mints, Calamint,
